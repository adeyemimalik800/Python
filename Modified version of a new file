Read the original file
with open("input.txt", "r") as infile:
    content = infile.read()

Modify the content (example: convert to uppercase)
modified_content = content.upper()

Write the modified content to a new file
with open("modified_output.txt", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(modified_content)

print("Modified file 'modified_output.txt' created successfully.")
python
filename = input("Enter the name of the file to read: ")

try:
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print("File content:\n")
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' does not exist.")
except IOError:
    print(f"Error: Could not read the file '{filename}'.")
